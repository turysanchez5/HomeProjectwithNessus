I will be downloading Nessus Essentials on my desktop and scanning my own network for vulnerabilities.

1. Ran a Google search to locate the Nessus Essentials Free Download. Selected appropriate platform and the lastest version of the software available.

2. Opened the Command Prompt on my desktop and ran ipconfig to get my IP Address. Created a Basic Network Scan which consisted of a name, description and the targets IP address.
